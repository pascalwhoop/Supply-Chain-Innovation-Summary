<!-- USAGE INFORMATION

 ## Information

To create this summary there are a few helpers to make work easier:

- first run `npm install -g typescript live-server` as well as `brew install pandoc` or in case of a linux distro `apt install pandoc` to allow live previewing of the created html
- running `npm install && npm start` will watch the desktop for new `.png` files and automatically copy them to the images folder.
    - new images will be numbered from 1,2,3,4,... all ending with the `.png` file type
- to build a pdf from the markdown one may use `npm run build-pdf`
    - please advise: `pandoc` as well as `latex` need to be installed on the system and available in the PATH env variable
- to build a html website from the markdown one may use `npm build`

To install pandoc and latex on Linux one may use:
`sudo apt install pandoc texlive-latex-base`
To use math, just use the normal latex notation.

`\\( f(x) = 2x \\)` for inline \\( f(x) = 2x \\)

and for block size math
```
$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$
```

$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$

### Overview
The class focuses on the innovation process within the supply chain of businesses. This broadly includes the entire product and service offering of a company as well as their improvement and innovation. The lecture is structured along the [Pentathlon Framework](#pentathlon) which is depicted below. At the end of each chapter, review questions are posed (by the professor) and answered (by me). At the end of the document, I will collect a list of terms which need to be known and hence should be memorized.

## Chapter 1: Types of Innovation

### What is Innovation?

-   Needs to be distinguished from creativity and inventions
-   linked to the idea of markets (hence demand and supply)
-   encompasses the entire process from the inception to the introduction and marketing of a new product/service/business model

**How to measure Innovation**? Such a loosely defined concept is difficult to measure and quantify. Several proxies can be choosen such as patents, R&D expenses or new product introductions. However, all those proxies suffer from common issues. While they are certainly all correlated with the innovation performance of a firm, the extend of the correlation can vary strongly. Some companies might not file patents. Some only focus on very few products. Some might have no explicit R&D cost as they have a culture of innovation that leads to each employee suggesting improvements.

### Innovation Dimensions and Degrees

**4 Dimensions**: Products, Services, Production and Business Processes.

Generally, it's also a difference whether a firm innovates it's process of production (or service) or its actual product.

**3 Degrees**: Incremental, Breakthrough and Radical Innovation

Generally, radical innovation is (obviously) more risky and rarely, projects aiming at radical innovation are on time, budget, spec and satisfy the customers demand. Hence, common patterns of budget allocation for the three kinds are 70:20:10.

### The Innovation Process and the Pentathlon Framework


The Pentathlon framework describes a funnel of filtering out many initial ideas to only select those with the highest chance of succeeding. To ensure innovation can succeed it is not only important to facilitate it by supplying all the necessary resources and create an environment that is open to innovation but it is also necessary to select and refine ideas and projects.

![](images/pascalwhoop/1.png)

Recent years have shown shifting areas of focus for research into innovation management. While the Stage Gate Model has been one of the most popular frameworks in the mid 90's, the interest has shifted towards more progressive ideas such as:

-   cultures of Innovation
-   disruptive Innovation
-   business model Innovation
-   Open innovation

especially the last field has seen large interests in recent years.

![](images/pascalwhoop/2.png)

### Innovation in Manufacturing vs. Services

Services are different from manufacturing as they don't output specific products. They are often:

-   **Intangible**: Meaning they have no physical representation.
-   **Customer contact intense**: Customers interact (often virtually / digitally) with the firm. New products require new approaches to the interactions with the C
-   **Inhomogeneous**: Because services are easily customizable, it is important to ensure each customer segment receives the tailed version of the service offering.
-   **Perishability**: Services don't have a time lag between production and delivery. A performed service is instantaneous, taking away any safety stocks possibilities.


### Review Questions

1. Conceptually, delineate innovation from (i) creativity and (ii) invention
    -   Innovation involves an entire process from start to finish, meaning not only to come up with a creative idea (i) but also to develop and construct it (ii) and then finalize it to allow delivery to the customers. It also requires ensuring a market for the product exists and it requires communicating the new product to potential customers.
2. How do product innovations relate to process innovation in chronological terms?
    -   Product innovation usually comes first. A new product gets developed and enters the market. Afterwards, the process of it's creation or delivery can be optimized.
3. Compare product innovations against process innovation by using the generic innovation funnel. Explain commonalities and differences.
    -   Process innovation is much easier to evaluate but much harder to generate. A well optimized process does not spawn many ideas for further improvements. However, once a potential improvement has been identified, it is much easier to evaluate the benefits and act upon it. A new product idea is quickly developed (many people have ideas, only few have great ones), but it requires consistent and strict filtering and selection to ensure the investments will pay off. While a process is a simple cost/utility calculation + a feasibility evaluation, a new product must also be evaluated regarding potential customer interests, feasibility of the whole supply chain and many other limiting factors.
4. Provide an example for an organization caught in the “Incremental Innovation Trap”. Why did that organization get caught in there?
    -   Nokia: The best phones of around 2005 were all made by either Motorolla (high end business class) or Nokia (large market share of mainstream). However, both failed to embrace the change in technology and did not adapt to the new trend of touch based modern modular app based OS platforms. Android and iOS wiped them both off the playing field.
        -   Why they got caught can only be guessed. Their technologies were good, highly refined and efficient. But their views were too strongly locked onto their *point of view*, meaning they couldn't see the benefits of the new products over their own. While they had strengths, the new competition had other advantages that answered the demand of the customers better. Once they tried to catch up, the technology gap between them and Google/Apple was too large to recover. Nokia tried with MS but even the software giant could not compete anymore.
5. How can “Incremental Innovation Trap” be explained by risk taking behavior?
    -   If the organization as a whole is risk averse, the willingness to approach a radical innovation may be low. If one applies the 70:20:10 rule, it is even worse, as only 1/10th of the overall R&D budget is applied to high risk projects and most of them will not succeed. It therefore requires conscious efforts to assure continuous investment and improvement upon all efforts to avoid irrational risk averse behavior and to ensure eventual success with radical innovation.

## Chapter 2: Innovation Context and Strategy

###  Innovation in Context

####  Adoption and Diffusion

![](images/pascalwhoop/3.png)

-   Some few adopters pick up on the product in the first phase of the release. If this point can be exited with a velocity of success, a typical adoption curve can be observed until the market is saturated

####  Technology S-Curves

As an example of technology development, the bicycle has slowly been emerging (1815 - 1861) for quiet a while. It has then seen rapid improvement in performance (1885 - 1895), after which it has been dormant for a long time (- 1970's) at which point innovation was retriggered by new materials and a new market demand for trendy styles.

![](images/pascalwhoop/4.png)

The curve is accompanied by 4 phases:

1. emerging
    -   Understand tech, find adopters, gain experience, advertise   
2. pacing
    -   demonstrate skills, find limits, standardize, respond to feedback, learn
3. key
    -   improve performance of product, master tech, grow market share
4. base
    - be reliable, affordable, be known and respected (marketing), diversify / complement

####  Dominant Designs and Punctuation

![](images/pascalwhoop/5.png)

###  The Need for an Innovation Strategy

If a company needs to improve its performance, it is helpful to **NOT**

-   have everyone either try new things all day without any goal or leadership
-   or have 50 people always doing the exact same thing over and over again without looking to serve the customer better and ignoring competition

Competitors **WILL BECOME BETTER** hence, a company must also improve its own performance. This is best done with:

-   a clear set of goals
-   a process of reaching those goals, given
-   approaches that can lead to the reaching of the goals

So we need: Ideas, development of these ideas and pulling through. If there are too many ideas, you need to choose the right one.

###  Tools for Strategic Analysis and Planning

####  Scenario Planning

Come up with a few dimensions of future developments of the environment:

-   Bitcoin rises, falls
-   Artificial Intelligence becomes more important, less important
-   Jobs in AI become: more / less abundant
...


####  Road Mapping

-   Time on x, different levels of abstractions / lanes
-   it's more about the process of thinking abuot these things than about the roadmap itself.


####  Kano Model and Matrix

![](images/pascalwhoop/6.png)

-   The kano matrix however can only show what *customers want* not *technology can provide*. If tech boundries/limits exist, the model is useless.
-   Many features move from a *delighter* to a *basic* feature, which is expected to exist in every instance of a product class. Cameras used to be a feature for phones and something special. These days, no one buys a phone without a camera.

####  Strategic Canvas

-   Depending on the market in which a company competes, very different strategies can be employed. IT consulting firms often cooperate to serve large customer demands as there is no *limiting* amount of demand. There is "enough for everyone", hence they try to work together to reach all customers instead of trying to steal customers from each other to increase their market share.


![](images/pascalwhoop/7.png)


###  Disruptive Innovation Strategies

Disruptive innovation (aka Christensen Model) is:

-   a late discovered Technology
-   that performs less well in some key dimensions
-   that might offer some additional performance dimensions that previous tech didn't offer
-   which quickly gains performance in key dimensions and exhibits a faster performance gain $\Delta$ than the previous tech

![](images/pascalwhoop/8.png)

This images neatly shows the difference between staying in the same technology landscape and innovating there vs. completely shifting to a new technology space and introduce a new product in this environment. An example can be made of the horse coaches and automobiles. No matter how good of a horse-breeder you were, once Fords came rolling around the corners, you lost your market.

A case can be made for the following:

-   **Performance oriented firm:** Focus on adaption strategies
-   **Competitor-oriented (Market)**: Focus on disruption strategies

### Review Questions

1. What is the conceptual difference between technology S-
curves and diffusion curves?
    -   S curves talk about the rate of innovation usually observed in the underlying technology and process environment. Diffusion curves talk about the adoption rate of a product by customers
2. What is the relation between diffusion and adoption curves?
    -   the diffusion is the integral $\int$ of the adoption function
3. How do Technology S-curves affect the Kano model analysis
for products relying on mature technologies? Explain briefly.
    -   Mature technologies usually exhibit all the key features expected by the customers. Therefore, it can help to discover discrete features that are not needed or may be replaced by a merged superset. Costs can be saved by combining many features into one solution that covers all or by cutting those features that aren't used by the main body of the users.
4. At which stage of a technology S-curve is the emergence of a
future dominant design most likely? Explain why.
    -   During the core functionality phase. Here, the largest success points of a product are discovered. The automobile is not successful because of the color of the radio buttons nor because of any one firm to push their brand image. It's successful because of it's key features (transportation, mobility, ...)
5. Discuss whether (or not) Tesla’s Model 3 is a disruptive
innovation.
    -   It might. If it can actually achieve what it is promising (mass production, low CO2 footprint, long-lasting functioning of the battery system) it can compete well with current cars. Current developments however give little hope that this will actually be the case. Car manufacturing simply is not as scalable as software products are. While it shook the market, it will not displace other competitors or grab a significant part of the market as others are also going to supply similarly competitive products.
6. How do firms’ performance benchmarks affect their
technology strategy choices? Why so?
    -   If they benchmark themselves against their previous years performance, they are fighting their own highscores and not those of the market. Other competitors might radically innovate and completely outperform the firm.

## Chapter 3: Generating Ideas for Innovation

### 1. The “Fuzzy-Front-End” of Idea Generation

Reiterating on the [Pentathlon Framework](#pentathlon), we look at the first part of the 3 steps: **Idea generation**

Sources of ideas are:

-   Internally generated (46%)
-   customers (23%)
-   competitor immitation (11%)
-   sales force, university, contractors, partners, supplier, ...

Key benchmark factors:

1. Number of ideas generated
2. Average $\mu$ quality of ideas generated
3. Variance $\sigma$ of ideas generated
4. The ability to select the best ones

### 2. Individual Ideation

Pareto principle strikes again: 80% of the best inventions come from 20% of the inventors. This makes sense. If "having ideas" is a skill, then the best at this come up with the majority of good ideas.

### 3. Collaborative Ideation

The infamous "brainstorming": Getting many ideas by many people and trying to cause cross-individual inspiration

#### Osborn's SCAMPER

- Substitute: Replace module, partner, product, source
- Combine: subcategories, factories, offers
- Adapt: ...
- Modify (Magnify, Minify)
- Put to other uses
- Eliminate
- Rearrange

There are more techniques for brainstorming methods. All of them aim towards generating many ideas based on adaption and reshuffling. None specifically aim for disruption though.

#### Dark sides of brainstorming
-   idea blocking
-   inefficient (1 speaks, rest listens)
-   free riding (group results may feel like partially own contribution)
-   groupthink and conformity

### 4. Identifying Hidden Needs: Lead User Theory

Users of a product range from casual users to high intensity users. iPads are used from playing card games on the couch all the way to complex educational system setups and professional artists.

Tapping into these lead users competencies can help a firm to find the needs of the larger population. The lead users can easily spot the "deligthers" (Kano model). The downside is the possible overengineering of a product. Too many features can scare off new users. Steep learning curves are the result of such innovation cycles.

### Review Questions

1. Why can specific individual ideators be highly valuable for companies?
    -   Because some few ideators often have the majority of good ideas. This is simply explainable if the "having ideas" activity is seen as a skill and every idea is a highscore or a lap record. The best usually lead the tables and equivalently, they lead the list of best ideas.
2. How does, ceteris paribus, an increase in number of ideas generated affect the quality (i) of the best idea and (ii) of an average idea? Explain.
    -   Generally, it depends on the process of increasing the number of ideas. If all other parameters stay the same, yet the individuals simply generate more ideas, statistically the chance of a positive outlier is higher. However, assuming the better ideas are shared earlier and the worse ideas are not shared or only shared when prompted, the overall quality is likely to suffer.
3. How does brainstorming (Osborn) make use of lateral and vertical thinking?
    -   It confronts the individuals with all the dimensions of a product and a competency and asks them to adapt and evaluate these adoptions on many different dimensions.
4. How can hybrid structures help overcome problems with traditional
brainstorming? (Use two problems of the traditional approach).
    -   inefficiency: Initially, everyone generates ideas by themselves. This increases the total number of ideas
    -   group-think: Because all members generate ideas in solitude, they generate them independent of the others. Only in the following steps, everyone gets introduced to the others ideas. Of course, this phase is still prone to group-think.
5. Instead of average customers, the lead user approach focuses on
extremely demanding customers. Why?
    -   because they usually know what features will make the product have a competitive advantage / a performance benefit and they can describe exactly where products have strengths and weaknesses
6. How does the lead user approach incorporate “normal” users?
    -   It brings many lead users of different product groups together. Some users are lead users in one domain but normal users in other domains. Hence, the lead users are confronted with the views of normal users who are specialists in other domains.
7. Reflect the lead user approach (coined by E. von Hippel) against disruptive innovation (coined by C. Christensen). Are there contradictions? If so, how can they be reconciled?
    -   Lead users might may be prone to adding "unneeded bells and whistles" to a product instead of focusing on the next iteration of product disruption. They are focused on their specialist skill-set and the domain in which they work. However, they might sometimes be able to see ways in which a subset of their favorite products be combined to one uniform product that can serve all their needs.

## Chapter 4: Protecting Ideas

###  Introduction to Intellectual Property Protection

-   Intellectual property is an **intangible asset** and **one of the most powerful assets for companies**
-   average value of Fortune 500 firms: 45-75% IP based

![](images/pascalwhoop/9.png)


###  Patents and Patenting

-   patents require detailed disclosure (description of functioning )
-   delivers right for exclusive use (within range of patent office applicability) for limited time
-   idea must be: novel, practical, inventive
-   idea **may not** be:
    -   scientific theory
    -   mathematical methods or models
    -   ways of doing business
    -   ...

**Advantages of patenting** are the exclusive rights of usage and the ability to license it to competitors as well the expression of competency. **Disadvantages** range from the long period until a patent is granted, the costs as well as the revelation of the technique to competitors. Costs can range from 6.000 to a 500k for a worldwide coverage.


###  Current Research: Patenting Strategies in Innovation Races

What is the "right" patenting strategy? What should be patented? What should not be patented? What market environment invites patenting and what prohibits it? What are the motives behind the invention?

####  Strategic Issues Pertaining to Patenting

Different strategies of patenting can be defined

![](images/pascalwhoop/10.png)

![](images/pascalwhoop/11.png)

####  R&D and Patenting Strategies on Technology Landscape

Paper written by Sting models and simulates situations of competing firms and their patenting strategies. The technology landscape is described as a n-dimensional continuous space. The space holds a complex polygon which
describes the paths of research to reach local (or global) maxima.

![](images/pascalwhoop/12.png)

The simulation works by performing many rounds of the game, each round consisting of each player investing into R&D and progressively improve their competencies. Afterwards the player can decide whether to patent or not to patent based on different strategies that are again modeled based on the algebraic properties of the model.

![](images/pascalwhoop/13.png)

If both players are "leaders" meaning their R&D strategy is better and therefore they perform better in their R&D efforts, a mixed strategy Nash-Equilibrium results. A leader vs. follower game is quickly observable to have a pure-strategy Nash-Equilibrium, as the "patent nothing" strategy by the leader dominates all other strategies.

###  Review Questions

1. What are the basic trade-offs in patenting?
    -   information disclosure vs. exclusive usage rights
2. Should an R&D leader always patent?
    -   No, a leader should follow a mixed strategy during a competition with another leader and shouldn't patent anything if he is the sole leader in the market.
3. When and why may “High-quality Patenting” backfire?
    -   If the competing firms do not patent anything and if they are either less performing than the own firm or if both firms are followers
4. How can “Patenting Everything” harm competitors?
    -   If two leaders compete and the competitor is not patenting anything, patenting everything blocks off access to the competitor but the own firm may keep using the same tech as the competition.
5. Why should a R&D leader competing with an R&D follower better rely on secrecy instead of patenting?
    -   Because the follower will otherwise use the patented technologies as a base from which to perform it's own R&D and therefore quickly jump from it's own tech base to the technology level of the leader.

## Chapter 5: Selecting Ideas and Building Portfolios

### Idea Selection

Going back to the [Pentathlon Framework](#pentathlon), the second phase, the selection and prioritization, requires approaches towards filtering the (vast) number of ideas and only select and pursue those that have a high chance of succeeding. As is the nature with ideas, measuring the future success is impossible, as success is based on attributes that cannot be measured before the implementation. So concepts focus on **expected performance** and **relative ratings** by comparing ideas with each other.

![](images/pascalwhoop/14.png)

While *more* ideas generally lead to a higher grade of the *best* idea, finding this best idea in all of the generated ideas becomes harder with an increasing number of competing ideas.

####  Qualitative Methods

Questions that might be asked:

-   is the opportunity real? Or is it targeting potential future environments?
-   Can you win? Will others be better?
-   Is it financially sustainable? Do you have the resources?

Dupont and 3M have deployed **scoring models** to rate an idea based on standard questions about "value", "attractiveness", "Fit to existing SC", ...

####  Quantitative Methods and Real Options Logic

![](images/pascalwhoop/15.png)

**Real options logic:** Make several small investments that deliver evidence of success or failure likelihood. According to information theory, the information for a "will produce profit X" is worth the same as the likelihood * expected profit.

####  Using Innovator Knowledge (Ongoing Research aka "Innovators Bias")

-   How likely are you to over (under) rate your own invention?
    -   Will you even share it? Or will you overrate your benign ideas?
-   Who are the people choosing the best ideas? Are they adding bias to the selection process?

Paper looks at different stages:
    -   Ideator's estimation of the idea value
    -   Accounting E(V) (expected)
    -   Accounting R(V) (realized)

It also looks at how different levels in the hierarchy influence the innovators bias.

### Portfolio management

Similar to financial portfolios. Finding a balance between risk and costs. Some investments are a big bargain and bring with them a large risk but large possible rewards while others give steady rewards for steady cost. But how to decide how much of each? Which type should receive how much attention, financial backing and trust?

#### Strategic Buckets Approach

![](images/pascalwhoop/16.png)

1. Define a set of innovation domains, or strategic buckets, each
corresponding to a combination of market and technology novelty.
2. Allocate resources across the buckets, reflecting their importance in
supporting your business strategy.
3. Select the best opportunities/projects within each bucket.

### Review Questions

1. What are advantages and disadvantages of using innovator knowledge for process idea evaluation and selection?
    -   Pro: The innovator is the best person to understand the idea and describe it's functionality and ability to perform. He came up with the idea and therefore knows it the best
    -   Con: The innovator is likely biased towards believing the idea is a good one. He would not have introduced it if he didn't believe it was a good idea. Hence, the questions about the quality of the idea should not be answered by himself.
2. At what stage of innovation are qualitative (resp., quantitative) innovation evaluation methods more adequate? Explain why.
    - quantitative evaluations are mostly short-term and are based on estimates about continuous values like profit and costs. Qualitative questions are more general, allowing an overall test of an ideas value. Qualitative questions can be asked to let the idea be further developed and extended to insure it's mature. Quantitative measurements can be used to continuously evaluate the expected return of a project and inform decision makers about likely bad or good investment probabilities.
3. What is the logic of applying “Strategic Buckets” to Innovation
Management? Explain the approach.
    -   It brings together qualitative concepts of technology and market environments with quantitative barriers and filters through financial limits
    -   It ensures a proper balancing between risky, novel market domains and less risky, continuous innovation.

## Chapter 6: Implementing Innovation

This chapter focuses on the third stage in the [Pentathlon Framework](#pentathlon), the *Implementation*.

### Implementing Innovation: Process View and Measurement

> How do processes differ from projects?

Projects are a one-time unique expenditure that usually tackel novel challenges and intend to lay the foundation for later utility. This can be creating a factory, building software or rescuing a capsized oil tanker. They all have in common the uniqueness of the activities and the utility that follows successful completion of the project. Of course, parts of the framework can be common tasks and there are often processes that are followed within projects.

In the context of SCI, projects are placed within an innovation process, which is a continuous operation of many projects regarding different R&D topics with the goal to receive *products, services, processes* or other forms of *new techniques and improvements* for the firm.

The control measures for SCI during the innovation process cover financial values, time values and portfolio balance values. Examples include:

-   % of revenue invested in R&D
-   % of product / process / service projects in pipeline
-   number of patents received
-   Average $\mu$ break-even point
-   Average $\mu$ time-to-market

Cooper (1999) observed:

> Too many projects jam the innovation model because of

- too many "must do" projects
- no strict Go/Kill decisions
- clear selection metrics and criteria to assess "goodness" of projects
- lack of senior people's engagement (this is always the best reason :-D )

A solution proposed by Cooper is the "Stage-Gate-Model" which regularly checks projects regarding continued fitness and value. Those projects that don't pass the gates are removed from the pipeline and terminated immediately, freeing up resources and reducing the project backlog. This is also a model trying to address the *sunk-costs bias*, by ignoring money already invested but solely looking at potential future results of each project.

![](images/pascalwhoop/17.png)

Gates include: *Proposal review, revenue-model review, research and feasibility, development progress, ...*

Gatekeepers are: upper management, external stakeholders (not project members), experienced project managers, business development officers, people without *ownership bias*

### Implementing Innovation: People Management

Motivating people for the actions in respect to (social) recognition and (financial) rewards:

![](images/pascalwhoop/18.png)

Since the organization is made up of teams and teams are made up of people, it is important to cascade the motivation's and goals of the organization down to the people, as they are the ones who make the achievement of the goals possible. It is therefore important to **align the organizations goals with those of the employees** through incentives, recognition of effort, payoff or other tools.

### Evaluating the Innovation Process: Innovation Audits

**Maturity stages of the NPD Process**

1. No process
    -   resource conflicts, no documentation, rules of thumb
2. Process defined but not used / known / good / accessible
    -   often ignored, seen as burden
3. Process used and understood, good for consistent NPD projects
    -   process understood, visible and used
4. Continuous Process Improvement: Everyone is living it
    -   meta-process reviews, metrics based, process is in cultural DNA of company

![](images/pascalwhoop/19.png)

-   **Ideas**
    -   source, quality, count of ideas, are they followed up on?
-   **Prioritization**
    -   balance between types / departments / offerings
    -   reviews, filtering, benchmarking, feedback
-   **Implementation**
    -   pipeline clogged? benchmark to competitors, process optimized, reviews focused
-   **Innovation Strategy**
    -   role of technology, top management inclusion, performance measures, innovation network?
-   **People and Organization**
    -   meaning understood by employees?
    -   individual targets < -- > company targets
    -   culture geared toward innovation




### Case: Accelerating Innovation through Collaboration

This part focused on *ROTO*, a company working on top hung pivot roof windows aka Dachfenster. The status-quo (before the project) was a central Lean Manufacturing Management system with digital visualisations of all projects, dependencies between systems and activities etc. While this was geared towards metric collection and dependency graph analysis, it wasn't tuned towards *human use*. The solution was to disregard the digital system and move towards a paper based in-office board system depicted below

![](images/pascalwhoop/20.png)

The new system was based on the following principles:

-   rigorous stage-gate planning
-   red-card signals to *call for help* by project members
-   change in culture, encouraging collaboration

![](images/pascalwhoop/21.png)

Was the digital model bad? Not necessarily. But while it collected data about progress, the usability of the interface was not necessarily good or enjoyable and the current progress of projects and the visibility of issues was not high. An alternative could have been to place displays with clear, distilled status information on the walls instead of the paper boards. But the question of expense-utility needs to be answered. It is quiet expensive to customize such tools while a company of 30 engineers might be just fine with a paper based approach without the ability to perform high-level analysis on it. Larger companies might on the other hand benefit from such digitally based systems.

**Effectiveness of PM is not only driven by 'technical sophistication' of planning tools. The tools need to fit the requirements by the group who uses them.**

### Review Questions

1. Why does a process view help in the implementation of innovations?
    -   Because, while each project is unique in its challenges and focus, all projects follow the same meta-process and are prone to similar challenges. Hence, a process view of the project progress helps to increase quality by avoiding common pitfalls
2. A typical concern is “in our company every innovation is different, so measurement of innovation is elusive”. How would you counter that concern?
    -   While every project is different, they all have similar challenges on a meta-level: competitor performance, cost, time-to-market, expected revenue $\delta$, third-party evaluation of proposal, development progress, forecasted velocity vs. actual velocity
3. Why can “strategy cascading” enhance the implementation of innovations?
    -   Because alignment of the firms goals with those of the individuals (or rather the other way around) is essential to have every individual work towards a similar goal. If individual A is incentivized to block innovation because its personal utility is higher when blocking it (such as keeping a job, gaining more money), innovation is blocked from within
4. How can “project-kill” decisions create value in a stage-gate process?
    -   by avoiding future costs that exceed utility. By avoiding *sunk-costs fallacies* by stakeholders and cutting losses
5. Why does an NPD process of highest maturity require regular process reviews?
    -   Because an innovation process in itself is not immune to change and needs to be updated to stay effective. If process X is valid for the NPD pipeline in 2000, it might be outdated in 2017 when new technologies, partners, strategic goals and other input values are changed.
6. Why is effective collaboration and communication among R&D employees crucial for the implementation of innovation?
    -   Because not everyone knows everything. Tapping into knowledge of other employees can save significant hurdles and also spawns creativity by getting outside opinions, new approaches to problems and often simple solutions with tools that the employee in question didn't know about.
7. How can a “red card process” of help create value for the firm? How could it lead to disadvantageous behavior from the firm’s perspective?
    -   It can help by helping employees get over blockades faster by seeking help and skills from others. Employees also share knowledge among each other and teach each other essential tools (while teaching also fosters learning in the teacher). It can be disadvantageous, if too many junior employees block the productivity of key employees who drive the innovation process value by having them constantly help and in return never manage to work on their own problems. This can be resolved in two ways: A, ensure only skilled/high potential personell is hired and unskilled personell is let go as not to block the seniors and B avoiding excessive churn in employees.

## Chapter 7: Supply Chain Innovation “Classics, Trends, and Hypes"

Forces of Innovation (typical name 5 exam question)
-   information
    -   Big Data making use of information
    -   Artificial Intelligence making use of
-   Mobile
-   Cloud Computing
-   Social (digital)

Gartner called this the "Nexus of forces" in 2014

### Supply chain innovation “classics”

Dimensions of Supply Chain Innovation (triangle of influence):
-   Supply Chain (Business) Processes
-   Supply Chain Technology
-   Supply Chain Network Structure

**Taylorism** describes a methodology according to Taylor that originates in the early 20th century. It breaks down works into many small fragments which don't require complex skill-sets and reduces learning time. This enables a well designed factory filled with unskilled labor to create complex machinery, controlled and steered by a different class of workers, the work-planning "Management" class.

#### Toyota Production System (1990s)

#### Amara's Law

> “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”

### Gartner’s hype cycle of emerging technologies

The hype cycle is made up of two separate developments: The Hype and the Maturity of technologies. As businesses and individuals are looking for the "next big thing", certain technologies get hyped as they appear on the market and lots of information is being spread about them in news, media and discussions. According to Amara however, the technology impact is overestimated in the beginning and so many hyped expectations result in a "Through of disillusionment" as the results cannot make up to the expectations. In the long run, the excitement dies down but the quality of the technology continuously improves and becomes mature.

### Review Questions

1.  Describe a supply chain example that illustrates the convergence and mutual reinforcement of social, mobility, cloud and information patterns visualized by the “Nexus of Forces”.
    -   Amazon: We share our new purchases on Instagram, Facebook etc, purchase them quickly and often on mobile devices, extend the functionality of those purchases with services from cloud offerings (Bluetooth streaming speaker + Spotify) and share all that usage information with Amazon which in turn analyzes it and understands better, what we are likely to buy next.
1.  Which three dimensions characterize supply chain innovations? Describe a supply chain innovation that illustrates their interconnectedness.
    -   TODO
1.  To what extent may the supply chain perspective itself (in contrast to logistics) be understood as an innovation?
    -   It considers a holistic view on a product, including both the sourcing as well as the customer experience and interaction with the company. Logistics simply focuses on moving goods and information from one location to another but SCM considers potential interactions, cooperations and mutual benefits through interacting and interconnecting with both customers and suppliers.
1.  Which ideas and concepts compose the hype cycle and what are its major implications?
    -   The hype-cycle is made up of two separate function terms. One describes the hype of new technologies, which usually occurs in the beginning of the emergence of such technologies. People discuss and share ideas about potential effects of such technologies and get excited about the potential implications. These expectations, often through social network effects, become much more expansive than the actual current state and performance of the technology. Only after a while, when the technology is matured, can it deliver on many of the ideas generated during the hype. However, this often comes too late and the hype tips over into negative press due to unsuccessful projects and reports of low performance. All the *subjective performance* doesn't however actually impact the *objective technology performance* and after a while, the combined function value rises again, due to increased realistic reports of the performance of technology.
1.  How can hype cycles be measured and in what data can they be tracked?
    -   Hype cycles can be measured through news outlets, sentiment analysis in text mining and research as well as project reports linked to the technologies referenced in the cycle.

## Chapter 8: SCI & Big Data

### 1. Problem statement & relevance

> “You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”

-   Information as the driver for decision making on all levels
-   data growth is exponential
-   **Challenge:** Identify and extract relevant information, make good decisions upon them

<a name="6v"></a>

#### Big Data 6V's

-   **Volume**
-   **Variety**
    -   regarding structuredness
-   **Velocity**
-   **Veracity**
    -   unreliable, misleading, biased, false information
-   **Variability**
    -   flow rate and sources
-   **Value**
    -   enrichment necessary to extract the valuable parts --> comparable to gold-mining

### 2. Big Data in SCM research

-   Picking up in recent years (2012-2016 from 0 to 600 articles)
-   Using publicly available data (Twitter/ Google Trends) to predict and monitor vs performance of *old-school* organizations

#### Case-Study: Otto + Blue Yonder

-   Otto used deep supervised learning to improve its automated replenishment decisions.
    -   input
        -   Internal: POS, Products, Locations, Promotions
        -   External: Weather, Day, Dates, Holidays
    -   output
        -   Forecasting of demand per product per day

In the next step, Otto then uses the forecasts to derive the optimal replenishment orders, which are constrained by some factors (capacity, delivery delay, min/max order quantities).

#### Performance

-   Data-Driven decision making increases **visibility** and **transparency**
-   Many factors, adding to a **0.72 coefficient of determination**
    -   Production analytics most valuable (cost?)
    -   Analytics of plan 2nd (but abstract?)
    -   IS systems support strong moderator <-- enabler


![](images/pascalwhoop/28.png)

#### Adoption

> Not everyone adopts. Why?

-   Not aware / too busy with day-to-day ops
-   internal blockades
    -   culture of privacy
    -   no IS competency
    -   mismanagement
    -   costly data sources
-   external blockades
    -   regulations / local laws
    -   partners not sufficiently digital
-   Looking for goal first
    -   firm doesn't want to collect information without reason
    -   can't see problems until you measure it
    -   but want problems visible before taking action

**3 Stages of adoption**:

1. Aspirational
    -   want to be analytic but just use data to justify
2. Experienced
    -   use analytics to guide
3. Transformed
    -   use analytics to determine action

![](images/pascalwhoop/29.png)

Who adopts? 0.3 adopt, but there are types of firms *more likely* to adopt:
-   larger / multi-location
-   IT-intensive / digitalized
-   educated & learning centered

#### Managerial implications

**HiPPOs: Highest-paid person's opinions**
-   Reducing the intuition based decision approach with rank overruling rationality towards data-driven and critically reflected decisions

**It's important to ask the right questions, not give authoritarian answers**

### 3. Opportunities and challenges
#### Mixed capabilities

- Claim: $H+M \leq M$
    -   Why? Who has final decision power? Does human input ideas or have final decision?

#### Data quality

> Trash in Trash out

Data has several dimensions of correctness that are required:
-   accuracy (of measurement / data)
-   timeliness (of delivery)
-   consistent (formatting)
-   complete (of records)

### Review questions

1. With which six V's may the term "big data" be characterized? Please illustrate each V with an example.
    -   [see above](#6v)
2. According to research findings, what is the impact of Big Data on firm performance?
    -   The space can explain about 0.6 of the variance in the measured firm performances
3. Why don’t all firms adopt the new technologies? Who adopts and who doesn’t?
    -   firms with internal / external blockades
    -   firms that are too late to the party (i.e. adopt as reaction to competition)
    -   firms that look for a reason to implement don't just want to "collect data for the sake of collection"
4. Given the particular strengths & weaknesses of computers vis-à-vis humans, how to best mix their capabilities for e.g. new product development?
    -   Let humans focus on their skills while making machines perform repetitive and error-prone tasks
5. What type of decisions mandate, in your opinion, to rely on data respectively on intuition? Please describe typical characteristics.
    -   Data: Opening a new remote office to be close to the customers --> perform customer analysis instead of going with the big hubs
    -   Intuition: Design decisions for product design (as long as the design cannot be field-tested and data collected)
