<p>University of Cologne winter semester 2017/18</p>
<p>Pascal Brokmeier</p>
<!-- USAGE INFORMATION

 ## Information

To create this summary there are a few helpers to make work easier:

- first run `npm install -g typescript live-server` as well as `brew install pandoc` or in case of a linux distro `apt install pandoc` to allow live previewing of the created html
- running `npm install && npm start` will watch the desktop for new `.png` files and automatically copy them to the images folder.
    - new images will be numbered from 1,2,3,4,... all ending with the `.png` file type
- to build a pdf from the markdown one may use `npm run build-pdf`
    - please advise: `pandoc` as well as `latex` need to be installed on the system and available in the PATH env variable
- to build a html website from the markdown one may use `npm build`

To install pandoc and latex on Linux one may use:
`sudo apt install pandoc texlive-latex-base`
To use math, just use the normal latex notation.

`\\( f(x) = 2x \\)` for inline \\( f(x) = 2x \\)

and for block size math
```
$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$
```

$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$

<h2 id="chapter-1-types-of-innovation">Chapter 1: Types of Innovation</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-innovation">What is Innovation?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Needs to be distinguished from creativity and inventions</li>
<li>linked to the idea of markets (hence demand and supply)</li>
<li>encompasses the entire process from the inception to the introduction and marketing of a new product/service/business model</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to measure Innovation</strong>? Such a loosely defined concept is difficult to measure and quantify. Several proxies can be choosen such as patents, R&amp;D expenses or new product introductions. However, all those proxies suffer from common issues. While they are certainly all correlated with the innovation performance of a firm, the extend of the correlation can vary strongly. Some companies might not file patents. Some only focus on very few products. Some might have no explicit R&amp;D cost as they have a culture of innovation that leads to each employee suggesting improvements.</p>
<h3 id="innovation-dimensions-and-degrees">Innovation Dimensions and Degrees</h3>
<p><strong>4 Dimensions</strong>: Products, Services, Production and Business Processes.</p>
<p>Generally, it's also a difference whether a firm innovates it's process of production (or service) or its actual product.</p>
<p><strong>3 Degrees</strong>: Incremental, Breakthrough and Radical Innovation</p>
<p>Generally, radical innovation is (obviously) more risky and rarely, projects aiming at radical innovation are on time, budget, spec and satisfy the customers demand. Hence, common patterns of budget allocation for the three kinds are 70:20:10.</p>
<h3 id="the-innovation-process-and-the-pentathlon-framework">The Innovation Process and the Pentathlon Framework</h3>
<p>The Pentathlon framework describes a funnel of filtering out many initial ideas to only select those with the highest chance of succeeding. To ensure innovation can succeed it is not only important to facilitate it by supplying all the necessary resources and create an environment that is open to innovation but it is also necessary to select and refine ideas and projects.</p>

<p>Recent years have shown shifting areas of focus for research into innovation management. While the Stage Gate Model has been one of the most popular frameworks in the mid 90's, the interest has shifted towards more progressive ideas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>cultures of Innovation</li>
<li>disruptive Innovation</li>
<li>business model Innovation</li>
<li>Open innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>especially the last field has seen large interests in recent years.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="innovation-in-manufacturing-vs.-services">Innovation in Manufacturing vs. Services</h3>
<p>Services are different from manufacturing as they don't output specific products. They are often:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intangible</strong>: Meaning they have no physical representation.</li>
<li><strong>Customer contact intense</strong>: Customers interact (often virtually / digitally) with the firm. New products require new approaches to the interactions with the C</li>
<li><strong>Inhomogeneous</strong>: Because services are easily customizable, it is important to ensure each customer segment receives the tailed version of the service offering.</li>
<li><strong>Perishability</strong>: Services don't have a time lag between production and delivery. A performed service is instantaneous, taking away any safety stocks possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="review-questions">Review Questions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Conceptually, delineate innovation from (i) creativity and (ii) invention
<ul>
<li>Innovation involves an entire process from start to finish, meaning not only to come up with a creative idea (i) but also to develop and construct it (ii) and then finalize it to allow delivery to the customers. It also requires ensuring a market for the product exists and it requires communicating the new product to potential customers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do product innovations relate to process innovation in chronological terms?
<ul>
<li>Product innovation usually comes first. A new product gets developed and enters the market. Afterwards, the process of it's creation or delivery can be optimized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compare product innovations against process innovation by using the generic innovation funnel. Explain commonalities and differences.
<ul>
<li>Process innovation is much easier to evaluate but much harder to generate. A well optimized process does not spawn many ideas for further improvements. However, once a potential improvement has been identified, it is much easier to evaluate the benefits and act upon it. A new product idea is quickly developed (many people have ideas, only few have great ones), but it requires consistent and strict filtering and selection to ensure the investments will pay off. While a process is a simple cost/utility calculation + a feasibility evaluation, a new product must also be evaluated regarding potential customer interests, feasibility of the whole supply chain and many other limiting factors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provide an example for an organization caught in the “Incremental Innovation Trap”. Why did that organization get caught in there?
<ul>
<li>Nokia: The best phones of around 2005 were all made by either Motorolla (high end business class) or Nokia (large market share of mainstream). However, both failed to embrace the change in technology and did not adapt to the new trend of touch based modern modular app based OS platforms. Android and iOS wiped them both off the playing field.
<ul>
<li>Why they got caught can only be guessed. Their technologies were good, highly refined and efficient. But their views were too strongly locked onto their <em>point of view</em>, meaning they couldn't see the benefits of the new products over their own. While they had strengths, the new competition had other advantages that answered the demand of the customers better. Once they tried to catch up, the technology gap between them and Google/Apple was too large to recover. Nokia tried with MS but even the software giant could not compete anymore.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can “Incremental Innovation Trap” be explained by risk taking behavior?
<ul>
<li>If the organization as a whole is risk averse, the willingness to approach a radical innovation may be low. If one applies the 70:20:10 rule, it is even worse, as only 1/10th of the overall R&amp;D budget is applied to high risk projects and most of them will not succeed. It therefore requires conscious efforts to assure continuous investment and improvement upon all efforts to avoid irrational risk averse behavior and to ensure eventual success with radical innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
